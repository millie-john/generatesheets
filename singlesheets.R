### Randomise hand movements
##-----------------------------------------------
# Trials   20
# Sample   R or L (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
# Reward   R or L (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
# Movement P or C (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
# Final    R or L (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
# 
# Sample and Reward (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
# Sample, Reward, and Movement (no more than 2 in a row and equal distribution)
#
# Generate 3 sheets at a time because I'm lazy and didn't change the code break function
# Individual sheets are named `Iteration_<number>.csv`
# Sheets will be generated in the folder location you are executing from, you can check this using `getwd()`
# You can change your working directory with `setwd()`, for example, `setwd("~/Desktop")`
#
# Packages are listed at the top and should auto-install if they are not already available.
